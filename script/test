# script/test: Run the test suite for the application.

#              Optionally pass in a path to an individual test file to run a

#              Use variables to control how you want to provision your local
#              environment.
#              Eg. `DOCKER=true script/console`
#              Or, add this as a global variable to your shell so it's set
#              automatically.
