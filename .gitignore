## How to use this file
#
# Add patterns to the section they apply to, sorted by:
#
#   1. absolute paths to or patterns for files (with a `/` prefix)
#   2. absolute paths to or patterns for directories
#   3. relative paths to or patterns for files (without a `/` prefix)
#   4. relative paths to or patterns for directories
#   5. pattern exceptions (sorted as above)
#
# Sort them alphanumerically within each section.
#
# If no section fits, create one. No path or pattern should exist without a
# section or label.
